Multiply by 2
-------------

This should solve my seven year old's curiosity once and for all.

Create program that multiplies by 2 until 100,000. That is, the program should print out:

1
2
4
8
16
32
64
128
etc... until you get above 100,000.

Do this in 2 different ways: First with a "while" loop and then an "until" loop.
