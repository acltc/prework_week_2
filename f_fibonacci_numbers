Fibonacci Numbers
-----------------

Instructions:

Fibonacci numbers are numbers that follow the pattern:
0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, etc.

That is, each number is the sum of the two numbers that precede it.

Write a program that prints out the first 100 fibonacci numbers. Use a loop!
