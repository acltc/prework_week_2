Division with Remainder
-----------------------

Instructions:

Write a program that asks the user for two numbers. The program will then divide the first number by the second number and return both the quotient and the remainder.

For example, if the user enters 10 and 5, the program will print out:

2 R0

And if the user enters 33 and 10, the program will return:

3 R3
