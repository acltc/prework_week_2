Secret Code
-----------

Let's assume that there is a secret code that works this way: Every letter has its mirror from the other half of the alphabet. Namely:

A = Z
B = Y
C = X
D = W
E = V
F = U
G = T
H = S
I = R
J = Q
K = P
L = O
M = N
N = M
O = L
P = K
Q = K
R = I
S = H
T = G
U = F
V = E
W = D
X = C
Y = B
Z = A

Write a program that takes user input and converts it into secret code. The program should also decipher an existing code and convert it back into English.
