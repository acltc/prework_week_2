Median
------

Instructions:

Create a program that asks the user to enter as many numbers as s/he wishes, and as soon as the user enters: 'done', the program stops asking for numbers. Then, tell the user the median number. The definition of a median number is found here: http://www.mathsisfun.com/median.html

Note from that article that the median is found differently, depending on whether there are an even or odd amount of numbers. Your program should handle both cases.
