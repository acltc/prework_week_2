Median
------

Instructions:

Create a program that asks the user to enter as many numbers as they wish, and as soon as the user enters: 'done', the program stops asking for numbers. Then, tell the user the median number. The definition of a median number is found here: http://www.mathsisfun.com/median.html

Note from that article that the method for determining the median can change depending on whether there are an even or odd amount of numbers. Your program should handle both cases.
