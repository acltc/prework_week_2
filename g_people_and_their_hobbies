PEOPLE AND THEIR HOBBIES
------------------------

Start with this line of code:

people = [
  {
    "first_name" => "Bob",
    "last_name" => "Jones", 
    "hobbies" => ["basketball", "chess", "phone tag"]
   },
   {
    "first_name" => "Molly",
    "last_name" => "Barker",
    "hobbies" => ["programming", "reading", "jogging"]
   },
   {
    "first_name" => "Kelly",
    "last_name" => "Miller",
    "hobbies" => ["cricket", "baking", "stamp collecting"]
   }
]

It's an array of hashes that is used to represent data about different people. Use an each within each to print out the list of everyone's hobbies in ALL CAPS. So the result should look like this:

BASKETBALL
CHESS
PHONE TAG
PROGRAMMING
READING
JOGGING
CRICKET
BAKING
STAMP COLLECTING
