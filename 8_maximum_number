Maximum Number
--------------

Or this one.

Have a user enter 10 numbers, and have it so that the program tells you the highest of all those numbers. Catch: Don't use the max method (which does that for you.) Use the "each" method instead.

Example: If the user enters:

5, 55, 66, 23, -123, 99, 4, 2, 100, 8

the program should say:

Your highest number is 100.
