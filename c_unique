Unique
------

Start your program with this line of code:

numbers = [4, 6, 1, 4, 2, 8, 3, 4, 1, 7]

The rest of your program should create and print out an array that only contains unique values from this original array. That is, the second array should look like: 

[4, 6, 1, 2, 8, 3, 7]

The one catch: Don't use the "uniq" method available to arrays! (That would do this for you.)
