Letters:
---------

This one is about as boring as you can get.

Instructions:

Start your program with this line of code:

letters = ["a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f", "g", "h", "i", "j"]

The rest of your program should print out every other letter. That is, the result in your terminal should be:

a
c
e
g
i
