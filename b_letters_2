Letters: The Sequel
-------------------

Instructions:

Start your program with this line of code:

letters = [["a", "b"], ["c", "d"], ["e", "f"], ["g", "h"], ["i", "j"]]

The rest of your program should print out the second letter from each inner array. That is, the result in your terminal should be:

b
d
f
h
j
