Instructions:

Write a program that asks the user for 5 words and creates a story out of it. For example, your program will have some sort of story template like this:

____name____ went to the store and bought a ___noun___. Then, the ____adjective____ ____noun____ yelled, "Quick! Go ____verb____ the police!"

In the above example, the program will ask the user for a name, a noun, an adjective, another noun, and a verb. After the user enters those words, the program will print out the completed story.

For this exercise, use interpolation (instead of concatenation). Both are methods of sticking variables (and other stuff) inside strings. Let's say you had a variable called word and wanted to stick it in the middle of a string:

Concatenation:

"The reason why " + word + " is a good thing is because it is."

Interpolation:

"The reason why #{word} is a good thing is because it is."

Note that you need strings with double-quotation marks in order to use interpolation.

Pro tip: Interpolation is always preferred over concatenation when possible. That's why we're using it in this exercise.
