Average
-------

Instructions:

Create a program that asks the user to enter as many numbers as s/he wishes, and as soon as the user enters: 'done', the program stops asking for numbers. Then, tell the user the average of all the numbers. 

Remember: To find the average of numbers, you get the sum of all the numbers and divide that sum by the count of how many numbers there are.

For example, if the user enters:
11, 7, 30, 22, 55

the average will be 25. (125 / 5)
