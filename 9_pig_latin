PIG LATIN
---------

Pig Latin is a very sophisticated language in which the each English word is converted as follows: The first letter of each word is removed from the beginning and added to the end. Then, the letters 'ay' are added to the very end of the word. 

For example:

hello = ellohay
pingpong = ingpongpay
marmalade = armalademay

Etcetra.

Write a program that accepts user input and prints out the Pig Latin version of that text.
